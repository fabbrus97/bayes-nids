simple fuzzer installation/building guide

simple fuzzer uses a custom configure script for building a standard GNU make
build script. running './configure' (or 'configure' for the windows users)
should work to build a script for a "standard" simple fuzzer distribution.

simple fuzzer also comes with some ssl plugin example, as well as a really 
simple sniffer called snoop. these may be enabled by turning on / off the
relevant switches during configuration. see './configure --help' for more
information on what switches are avaiable.

once configured, simply run 'make' and sfuzz, as well as the optional packages
should be built. from there, a 'make install' will install simple fuzzer into
PREFIX/bin and PREFIX/share/sfuzz-db. alternatively, you may simply run simple
fuzzer from the local directory with ./sfuzz <options>

uninstallation is simply running make uninstall.

NOTES: Windows users - make install / uninstall do not work properly. Refrain
       from using this procedure.

simple fuzzer 0.6 has been tested to work only on the GNU/Linux operating
system, and Windows XP currently. sqa efforts to test on freebsd, os x, and 
windows Vista->7 are under way, and any resulting bugs will be fixed as a
patch.
